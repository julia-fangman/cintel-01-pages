# Julia's Website 

My first website using Markdown and GitHub Pages.

## My Link

Here's a clickable link: [Github Profile](https://github.com/julia-fangman)

## Images

Images look like links except with an exclamation directly in front

## Reminders

Use a dash space for unordered lists

- Spaces matter

- Spelling matters

- Capitalization matters
